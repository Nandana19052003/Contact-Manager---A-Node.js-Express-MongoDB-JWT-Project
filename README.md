# Contact-Manager---A-Node.js-Express-MongoDB-JWT-Project
This is a Contact Manager project built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and JWT (JSON Web Tokens). The project aims to help users manage their contacts securely by providing features like adding, updating, and deleting contacts with JWT-based authentication.

It helped me learn about the fundamental concepts of Node.js and Express, working with MongoDB for data storage, and implementing JWT for secure user authentication. It's a practical hands-on project that showcases my understanding of these technologies.
